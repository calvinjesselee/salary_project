Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer,$67K-$106K (Glassdoor est.),"Who we are

Zinier is a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California, with offices in Mexico City, Singapore, and Bengaluru and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Founders Fund.

Why we exist

Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.

For organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.

To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.

What we're looking for

To match our continued, exponential, solution and platform growth, Zinier is tasked with making sure all the software operations in place are running as effectively as possible. The DevOps team is in charge of automating the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

The Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer will be in charge of owning and handling all aspects of solution development - architecture, design, development, build, deployment, monitoring, and operations, accounting for near-term product deliverable and technical debt. As a very hands-on role, this engineer will be putting together the 'pipeline' that takes our product code from development, complete to ""ready for the customer to use""; this includes testing, and staging for release. This role will also deal with 'provisioning' clients - setting them up in the various systems so they can enjoy the new product. This role is very hands-on and meant for someone who wants to eventually evolve into a DevOps Architect and/or lead a team of his or her own.

Role Responsibilities
Responsible for cloud infrastructure standards, design, systems analysis, security, data center operation, compute, storage, network communication.
Set and drive the implementation of standards, advise teams of IT technology standard requirements, methodology, and processes.
Define and maintain DevOps pipeline architecture and tooling requirements and analyze and design modifications to existing systems to support new solutions.
Build the business case for changes in the infrastructure architecture strategies while implementing DevOps practices such as infrastructure as code, continuous integration and automated deployment.
Architect scalable, highly available application solutions that leverage AWS services and or other Cloud Providers
Work directly with business users to translate requirements into designs and ultimately develop and deploy secure cutting-edge solutions that leverage cloud-based solutions.
Build and develop a visionary direction and roadmap for Infrastructure-as-a-Service throughout the enterprise through collaborating and evangelizing the right cloud solutions with peer organizations and senior leadership.
Analyze and design modifications to existing systems to support new solutions, and design and develop infrastructure blueprints for the implementation of new solutions.
Cross-collaborate with the cloud architecture team, the infrastructure team, project management team, and technology services management team to design the proper pathways to success and conduct end-to-end technical plan design.

for development of complex electrohydraulic, electromechanical, and
electropneumatic Test Equipment that will test and verify products of Moog,
Inc. You will plan and conduct efforts requiring judgment in the independent
evaluation, selection, and substantial adaptation and modification of standard
engineering techniques, procedures, and criteria. Typically, the Design
Engineer devises new approaches for the problems encountered.

The Sr. Electrical Design Engineer is a key contributor to the
analysis, conceptual design, development, and testing of complex control
hardware used on Military and Commercial aircraft and associated test
equipment. The products of Moog generally are unique for each customer.

though adaptation of existing designs always should be considered where
appropriate.

In the early stages of a new program, the project team will consult with the
customer, establish the problem statement, conceive of potential hardware
solutions to the problem, often through extensive trade studies, and then
create a successful technical proposal. This phase is critical in that it
establishes the basis for future design, and for contract negotiations. Under
the technical direction of the Engineering Manager, Section Head or the team's
lead engineer, the Sr. Electrical Design Engineer will then guide the evolution
of the conceptual design, technical project planning, detail design, and
development testing. This requires some travel and the participation in
presentations to customers.
