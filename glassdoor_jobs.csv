Principal or Senior Engineer - Bus Rapid Transit (BRT),$117K-$157K (Glassdoor est.),"WHO WE ARE

We are the Metropolitan Council, the regional government for the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area. We plan 30 years ahead for the future of the metropolitan area and provide regional transportation, wastewater, and housing services. More information about us on our website.

We are committed to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve.

Metro Transit is one of the country's largest transit systems, employs more than 3,000 people, and provides more than 80 million rides a year through an integrated network of buses, light rail, and commuter trains, as well as resources for those who carpool, vanpool, walk, or bike in the Twin Cities.

The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Projects department is responsible for planning, design, and implementation of high-profile, multi-departmental BRT corridor projects. Within BRT Projects, this position will focus on arterial BRT projects, like the highly successful METRO A Line and METRO C Line. These projects bring fast, frequent, and high-quality transit service and customer facilities to the region's busiest bus routes in the core of the region. The current $200 million program of projects in active development includes the 18-mile METRO D Line (Chicago/Emerson-Fremont), 13-mile METRO B Line (Lake/Marshall/Selby), and 13-mile METRO E Line (Hennepin/France).

How your work would contribute to our organization and the Twin Cities region:

As a Principal or Senior Engineer in BRT Projects, you will join a passionate and skilled team of transit professionals committed to growing regional prosperity and addressing inequity through building out the Twin Cities region's bus rapid transit network. Bringing enthusiasm for transit, strong technical skills, and advanced organizational abilities, you'll lead design of stations, systems, and bus priority treatments on arterial BRT projects.

Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer,$67K-$106K (Glassdoor est.),"Who we are

Zinier is a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California, with offices in Mexico City, Singapore, and Bengaluru and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Founders Fund.

Why we exist

Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.

For organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.

To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.

What we're looking for

To match our continued, exponential, solution and platform growth, Zinier is tasked with making sure all the software operations in place are running as effectively as possible. The DevOps team is in charge of automating the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

The Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer will be in charge of owning and handling all aspects of solution development - architecture, design, development, build, deployment, monitoring, and operations, accounting for near-term product deliverable and technical debt. As a very hands-on role, this engineer will be putting together the 'pipeline' that takes our product code from development, complete to ""ready for the customer to use""; this includes testing, and staging for release. This role will also deal with 'provisioning' clients - setting them up in the various systems so they can enjoy the new product. This role is very hands-on and meant for someone who wants to eventually evolve into a DevOps Architect and/or lead a team of his or her own.

Role Responsibilities
Responsible for cloud infrastructure standards, design, systems analysis, security, data center operation, compute, storage, network communication.
Set and drive the implementation of standards, advise teams of IT technology standard requirements, methodology, and processes.
Define and maintain DevOps pipeline architecture and tooling requirements and analyze and design modifications to existing systems to support new solutions.
Build the business case for changes in the infrastructure architecture strategies while implementing DevOps practices such as infrastructure as code, continuous integration and automated deployment.
Architect scalable, highly available application solutions that leverage AWS services and or other Cloud Providers
Work directly with business users to translate requirements into designs and ultimately develop and deploy secure cutting-edge solutions that leverage cloud-based solutions.
Build and develop a visionary direction and roadmap for Infrastructure-as-a-Service throughout the enterprise through collaborating and evangelizing the right cloud solutions with peer organizations and senior leadership.
Analyze and design modifications to existing systems to support new solutions, and design and develop infrastructure blueprints for the implementation of new solutions.
Cross-collaborate with the cloud architecture team, the infrastructure team, project management team, and technology services management team to design the proper pathways to success and conduct end-to-end technical plan design.
Develop long-term strategies for historical data retention and archival plan for storage needs, defines data retention, backup, and recovery methods and plans taking direction from legal in process.
Coordinates technical kick-off sessions by providing detailed product architecture overviews and determining the customer's design, integration and development plans.
